UGC confers academy autonomy to GNDEC for ten years.
Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) has been conferred academic autonomy by University Grants Commission (UGC) for another 10 years in the third cycle. Under this autonomy, the institution will have liberty to design its own curriculum and syllabus as per need of the hour. New programs and courses in the emerging areas can also be started by the college under the autonomous status. While GNDEC is accredited by NAAC with A grade and most of the engineering courses are accredited by NBA, the UGC autonomy will play big role in imparting quality education. Dr. Sehijpal Singh Principal confirmed that official communication has been received from the Ministry of Education, Govt of India. The required information in the prescribed format was submitted to the commission in February 2022 and on the basis of this information, the decision of imparting academic autonomy to GNDEC has been taken in the recent meeting by the ministry.  ‚ÄúIt will help us to adopt and exercise many features of National Education Policy (NEP 2020)‚Äù Dr Akshay Girdhar Dean Academic said. He further added that the skill and knowledge of students can be enhanced by following NEP for which the academic autonomy provides large number of flexibilities and options.

Gurcharan Singh Grewal and other members of GB,  S Sukhminder Singh Secretary education and Nankana Sahib Education Trust (NSET) , and S Inderpal Singh Director NSET applauded and congratulated entire faculty, staff and students for this¬†achievement.
